# üì∞ Fake News Detector

A **machine learning-powered Flask web app** that classifies news articles as *real* or *fake* using a **Logistic Regression** model and **TF-IDF vectorization**.
Built with **Python, scikit-learn, and Flask**, and deployed on **Vercel** (backed by Azure infrastructure) for scalability and low-latency inference.

---

## üìö Overview

This project demonstrates a practical end-to-end **text classification pipeline**:

* Preprocess text using **TF-IDF vectorization**
* Classify using a **Logistic Regression** model trained on labeled news datasets
* Serve predictions through a **Flask API**

The model was trained on data up to **December 2018** and is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User sends text** to the `/predict` endpoint.
2. **TF-IDF vectorizer** transforms the text into numerical features.
3. The **trained logistic regression model** predicts whether the text is *real* or *fake*.
4. Flask returns a JSON response containing the classification result.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is deployed on **Vercel**, running on **Azure Virtual Machine infrastructure**.
Deployment includes:

* Flask backend API (`app.py`)
* Model pickles:

  * `model/logistic_model.pkl`
  * `model/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`

Both files are bundled in the deployment bundle to enable instant loading on cold start.

## üß© Quick Deployment (Option 1: Include Pickles in Repo)

If you want the **fastest working deployment**, simply include your model pickles in the repository.

### 1. Stop ignoring `model/`

If your `.gitignore` contains this line:

```gitignore
model/
```

Comment it out or remove it:

```gitignore
# model/
```

### 2. Re-add the model files and push

```bash
git add model/logistic_model.pkl model/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
git commit -m "Add trained model pickles for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Re-deploy on Vercel

In the **Vercel Dashboard**, trigger a redeployment of your project.
The build will now include the `model/` directory, ensuring Flask can load your pickles at runtime.

---

## üîç Smoke Test (after deployment)

Once deployed, run a quick sanity check from your local terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "This is a test news article to classify."}' -v
```

You should receive a JSON response indicating whether the input text is **real** or **fake**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Best Practices

* **Option 1** (bundling pickles) is fine for small projects and quick fixes.
  For production setups, consider **Option 2** (hosting pickles on object storage such as AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2) and set:

  * `MODEL_URL`
  * `VECTORIZER_URL`
    environment variables in your Vercel settings.
* Ensure `requirements.txt` **pins versions** of `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn` to avoid binary incompatibilities when unpickling.

Example:

```txt
numpy==1.26.4
scipy==1.13.1
scikit-learn==1.5.1
Flask==3.0.3
```

## üß™ Local Development

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector.git
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask app locally:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

4. Send a test request:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Sample headline for prediction."}'
   ```
